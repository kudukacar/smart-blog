          <p>A physical therapist since 1999, and frustrated with the hastened care at outpatient facilities, Manju Thomas turned to home visits to thoughtfully deliver high-quality one on one care.  She enjoys working with the older adult population to promote function, and return to activity.  She received her Masterâ€™s in Physical Therapy from Washington University in St. Louis (#1 ranked physical therapy school). She is licensed in New York, and is Otago trained for fall prevention.</p>
