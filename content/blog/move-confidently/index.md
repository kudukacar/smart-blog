My 93 year old client recently asked me if he would improve.  He walks with his feet wide apart, slowly and cautiously, takes very small steps, and because of his fear of falling, walks minimally.  He fell once over the past year, while turning, and thanks to the helpful hands of New Yorkers, avoided many falls.  I told him with persistence and effort, he could walk more, with greater confidence and fewer falls.

Research shows, you need at least 50 hours of strength and balance exercises to reduce your risk and rate of falls.  For example, the evidence based Otago exercise program reduces falls by about 40%, and is most effective for adults 80 years and older.  The program consists of strength and balance exercises administered by a physical therapist through seven home visits over the course of a year.  The client performs the exercises every other day, and on off days, walks for about 30 minutes.  Get in touch to start your program today.
