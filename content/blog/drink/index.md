You don’t typically think of a urinary tract infection (UTI) as a physical therapy diagnosis, but we see many physical therapy referrals as a result of UTIs.  UTI’s contribute to falls, and physical decline.  You can prevent or resolve UTI’s by simply drinking enough fluids.  I see clients lean on cranberry juice when suspecting a UTI, but [research shows](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-44047013), drinking water or other fluids is more effective.  Also, antibiotics may only be necessary if symptoms do not improve after 48 hours or worsen suddenly.

Staying hydrated is also important for people taking blood pressure medication.  Blood pressure medication may contribute to dizziness when standing up, and subsequent loss of balance.  Drinking enough water or fluids reduces this symptom.

[The U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20National%20Academies%20of,fluids%20a%20day%20for%20women) recommends 15.5 cups of fluids a day for men, and 11.5 cups of fluids a day for women.  Fluids include water, other beverages such as milk and juice, and fluid from food such as fruits and vegetables.  

Stay hydrated, and remain healthy.
