A client of mine complains of terrible arthritis in her knees.  She uses a cane, and does not qualify for total knee replacements because of her pre-existing conditions.  She also does not like to move because of the pain, preferring to sit as she finds this position most comfortable.  I encourage her to walk, and stretch and strengthen her muscles, but she finds little motivation because of pain.  According to [Harvard health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/managing-osteoarthritis-of-the-knee), lack of exercise contributes to the development of knee osteoarthritis, pain makes a person avoid exercise, and avoiding exercise makes arthritis worse.  Exercise breaks this cycle.  Light to moderate exercise slows arthritis disease progression, and reduces pain.  Manage arthritis and maintain mobility with a combination of aerobic, functional strengthening, stretching, and balance exercises.
